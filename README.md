# ðŸ§  Autism Predictor ML

A machine learning-based web application that predicts autism traits based on user-input features. This project explores various classification models to identify the most accurate predictor. After comprehensive evaluation, the **Random Forest Classifier** was selected for deployment, achieving a **cross-validation accuracy of 92%**.
